An essential important component of effective strength training is getting enough protein. Your body needs protein to build muscle, and it needs a lot of it. The general recommendation for people who are actively strength training is to get around a gram of protein per pound of weight in pounds. That is, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should consume anywhere from 120–180 grams of complete protein throughout the day. If you’ve got a lot of body fat, adjust to the lower end of that range, etc.

For the omnivores among us, this is easy: eat a serving of animal protein with every meal, and you’re probably set. It’s not so simple for vegetarians. For one thing, there aren’t that many good vegetarian sources of protein. A lot of them end up on many people’s picky-eating list: cottage cheese, greek yogurt, fake meats like tofu and seitan, lentils and beans. Additionally, plant sources of protein are usually not complete proteins. That is, they don’t contain all nine amino acids that humans need.
