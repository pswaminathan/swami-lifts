*TL;DR*: Go [follow me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/swamilifts/) and yell at me to get stronger.

When I started lifting weights, it wasn’t with much purpose. I had this generic idea of “fitness,” which involved lots of cardio, and a little bit of strength training. I ran cross country and played tennis in high school (both exceptionally poorly), and there isn’t much concept of strength training there. I briefly tried [StrongLifts](https://stronglifts.com/) after graduating college, and ran it for a few months. This petered out too. I still didn’t have much purpose in lifting weights, and without any accountability, stopped going to the gym regularly.

In 2017, I got back into it. I had a clear purpose: to look better for my wedding. “Better” was still somewhat nebulous: less fat, more muscle. I picked StrongLifts back up, and to my surprise, I loved it. Somehow getting stronger actually made day-to-day life better. Moving a couch into a new apartment was made easier when I could deadlift 185. Bringing home groceries was made easier when I was no longer sore after doing it. Even more to my surprise, I could run a 5k out of the blue without having to train for it. Additionally, it just *felt good*. Having more muscle mass just felt good. Who knew?

In the last year, I’ve been running StrongLifts, and interspersed with a few months here and there of cutting body fat. At this point, I’m no longer making progress running a linear progression, either at 5x5 or at 3x5 (a la [Starting Strength](https://startingstrength.com/)).

So what’s next? I spent February through May cutting body fat, ending up about 15 pounds down from where I started the year. I wanted to spend some time maintaining where I’m at right now. Additionally, I wanted to compete. I don’t have any aspirations of competing at a high level, but I recently saw [a video](https://youtu.be/Ebtpu3_3Pu8) about the merits of competing. The gist here is that a competition gives you a concrete goal to work toward, a concrete end of a training cycle. Additionally, it gives you something to hold yourself accountable: You’ll cut fewer corners in training and take it more seriously when you have a date set to keep you accountable. So I’ll be competing in a powerlifting competition at the end of August.

To train for this competition, I’m going to run a program template known as the [Texas Method](https://startingstrength.com/article/the_texas_method). And I’m going to do it publicly, on Instagram! Come follow me [at swamilifts](https://www.instagram.com/swamilifts/) and yell at me to get better at pressing.
