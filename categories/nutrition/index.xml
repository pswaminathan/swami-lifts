      <description>If you want to get stronger, you need to get enough protein. Your body needs protein to build muscle, and it needs a lot of it. The general recommendation for people who are actively strength training is to get around a gram of protein per pound of weight in pounds. That is, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should consume anywhere from 120â€“150 grams of protein throughout the day.</description>
