      <description>A few months ago, video surfaced of LeBron James doing an unusual wide-stance quarter squat. The internet exploded into two camps:
 Quarter squats aren’t squats! Squat to depth! Quarter squats are better for athleticism than full squats!  Both of these camps have some points on their side. But I don’t want to talk about which of these camps is “right” here. Sure, if we only had one barbell exercise we could do for maximum athletic development, we could have a discussion on what kind of squat is best for this purpose.</description>

      <description>If you want to get stronger, you need to get enough protein. Your body needs protein to build muscle, and it needs a lot of it. The general recommendation for people who are actively strength training is to get around a gram of protein per pound of weight in pounds. That is, if you weigh 150 pounds, you should consume anywhere from 120–150 grams of protein throughout the day.</description>
